  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Kathak expresses intricate patterns that delight seasoned rhythm enthusiasts and new audiences alike. Its ever-flowing, playful yet agile movements carry lightness, joy, and depth alike, allowing a single performance to hold festive exuberance, profound emotion, or dazzling technical complexity, often drawing the audience into a trance of motion and expression… enchanting the old and young.</p>

  <p>My journey with Kathak began at six, guided by my parent’s encouragement, and has evolved from admiring senior dancers to discovering and shaping my own voice within this classical art form. I have been fortunate to learn under the guidance of Guru Nrityashri Alaknanda at AIPA Institute, affiliated with Akhil Bharatiya Gandharva Mahavidyalaya. I hold a Visharad and have performed on various platforms, from local and academy stages to international events.</p>

  <p>I approach Kathak with focus, depth, and emotional resonance, expressing each rhythm, story, and gesture with full engagement and sensitivity, drawn to the very essence of music and movement across different forms.</p>

  <p>Currently, I focus on deepening my Kathak practice and exploring new creative possibilities.</p>

  <p>Finally, through Kathak, I seek to create moments that linger with the energy and subtlety of motion, music, and rhythms. I invite the audience to feel, reflect, and be moved. Each performance becomes a bridge between tradition and emotion, meant to rejoice and awaken curiosity in those who witness with their hearts open.</p>
